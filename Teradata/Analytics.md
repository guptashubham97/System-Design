# Advanced Analytics
• PageRank – assigns an importance or influence value
to nodes in a network based on which the value,
importance, or influence of that node can
be determined

• nPath – to identify the most common consumer
paths to defined events such as buying a product,
abandoning a shopping basket, or closing their account
• Shapley Value – a cooperative game theory construct
where a specific distribution of values are generated
across a set of participants who operate in a coalition

• SAX – machine data analysis, such as analysis of
sensor data in manufacturing. In addition to identifying
anomalies in manufacturing processes

• Shapelets – time series subsequences which are
representative of an underlying data class

• Confusion Matrix – machine learning for quantifying
the performance of an algorithm to improve
predictive models

• Single Decision Tree – (build and apply a single
decision tree for classification and Identify important
variables that are critical to decision-making

• Distribution Matching – hypothesis testing of data
origins from a specific distribution and parametric
estimation

• Collaborative Filter – used in recommendation
engines to create classes of entities for further action,
eg., purchase, based on previous actions

• Spark MLlib – used by data scientist to access a
growing library of open source analytic functions. For
example, the Spark connector allows analyst to quickly
access Spark deep learning algorithms without having
to know Scala


## Visualization
Visual MapReduce functions that are massively parallel,
in-database, in-process and out-of-the-box, providing
novel visualizations to make it faster and easier to discover
new insights from big data. They complement existing
business intelligence and visualization tools by providing
purpose-built visualization capabilities best suited
to represent the in-depth insights offered by Teradata’s
patented MapReduce framework. A sample set of
capabilities include:

• Flow Visualizer – understand the path taken leading
to an outcome such as purchase or downloads

• Affinity Visualizer – understand how two sets of
seemingly different products or services actually have
a close connection and hence can be bundled

• Hierarchy Visualizer – organize all discrete entities and
interactions into hierarchies to better understand and
comprehend the relationships and behaviors. Teradata
also provides the flexibility to integrate your favorite
BI and visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Microstrategy,
Tibco Spotfire, IBM, Cognos) to easily operationalize
your analytics. In addition, Teradata provides tools
such Guided UI and Tango to simplify access and
accelerate the analytic process.
